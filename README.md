In this project, I applied statistical techniques to perform a funnel analysis on Swiggyâ€™s 2019 session data to understand user behavior and optimize conversions:

1. Data Analysis: Analyzed user sessions and conversion rates at various stages of the funnel, identifying key traffic sources, drop-offs, and conversion points.
2. Statistical Techniques: Used descriptive statistics to identify trends and anomalies, and validated hypotheses with metrics to guide business strategies.
3. Insights: Examined order trends and traffic fluctuations, revealing insights into customer behavior and patterns affecting conversions.
4. Recommendations: Based on the data, provided actionable insights to improve user acquisition, retention, and conversion rates for Swiggy's platform.

   
This project highlights my ability to apply statistical methods to real-world data for actionable business insights and strategic decision-making.
